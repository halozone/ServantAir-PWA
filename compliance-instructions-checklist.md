## 🎯 Compliance Tips

### Best Practices
1. **Set Multiple Reminders**: 60 days, 30 days, 15 days before due
2. **Track Tach Time**: Use tachometer (not Hobbs) for 100-hour compliance
3. **Bundle Inspections**: Combine 24-month inspections to save money
4. **Schedule Early**: Book maintenance 30+ days in advance
5. **Budget Ahead**: Set aside 10-15% of aircraft value annually for maintenance
6. **Review Monthly**: Check all compliance dates first of each month
7. **Document Everything**: If it's not in the logbook, it didn't happen
8. **Know Your Operation**: Understand Part 91/61/141/135 requirements

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- ❌ Using Hobbs meter for 100-hour calculations (use tach!)
- ❌ Forgetting 7-year registration renewal
- ❌ Not budgeting for annual inspection discrepancies
- ❌ Flying with expired VOR check when using VOR for IFR
- ❌ International flight without proper FCC license
- ❌ Operating Part 135 without manufacturer TBO compliance
- ❌ Incomplete logbook entries (missing signatures/certificate numbers)
- ❌ Not tracking Airworthiness Directive recurring compliance
