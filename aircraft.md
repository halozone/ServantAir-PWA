## Compliance Penalties & Enforcement

### **FAA Enforcement Philosophy**

**Regulation:** FAA Order 2150.3C - Compliance and Enforcement Program

**Approach:**
1. **Compliance First** - FAA seeks voluntary compliance when possible
2. **Administrative Actions** - Corrective actions and remedial training
3. **Certificate Actions** - Suspension or revocation of certificates
4. **Civil Penalties** - Monetary fines for violations

---

### **Civil Penalty Amounts (2025)**

**Adjusted Annually for Inflation per Federal Register**

| Violation Type | Maximum Penalty |
|----------------|-----------------|
| General aviation violations (Part 91) | $15,625 per violation |
| Commercial operator violations (Part 135) | $37,500 per violation |
| Hazardous materials violations | $96,624 per violation |
| FCC radio violations | $10,000 per violation |
| CBP customs violations | $5,000 per violation |

**Note:** Penalties can be assessed **per flight** or **per day** depending on violation type

---

### **Common Maintenance Violations and Penalties**

---

### **Certificate Actions**

**Types:**
1. **Warning Notice** - Informal action, no appeal rights
2. **Letter of Correction** - Educational, not punitive
3. **Certificate Suspension** - Temporary loss of certificate (30-180 days typical)
4. **Certificate Revocation** - Permanent loss of certificate

**Factors Considered:**
- Nature and severity of violation
- Hazard to air safety
- Whether violation was inadvertent or deliberate
- Prior compliance history
- Corrective action taken
- Attitude of violator

---

### **Criminal Penalties**

**When Applied:**
- **Willful violations** that endanger safety
- **Fraud** in maintenance records or applications
- **Operating unairworthy aircraft** knowing it to be unsafe

**Penalties:**
- Fines up to $250,000
- Prison sentences up to 3 years
- Both fines and imprisonment

**Examples:**
- Falsifying maintenance logbooks
- Operating with known unairworthy condition

---

### **Insurance Implications**

**Non-Compliance Effects:**
- Insurance may be **voided** if accident occurs with expired inspections
- Claims may be denied if aircraft not airworthy
- Premiums may increase after violations
- May be dropped by insurance carrier

---

### **Liability Exposure**

**Civil Liability:**
- Owner/operator liable for damages in accidents
- If negligence proven (e.g., flying with expired annual), liability greatly increased
- Lawsuits from passengers, third parties, property damage

**Vicarious Liability:**
- Owner liable for pilot's actions if aircraft not airworthy
- Flight schools liable for student accidents if aircraft maintenance deficient

---

### **How Violations Are Discovered**

1. **Ramp Checks** - FAA inspectors randomly inspect aircraft and documents
2. **Accident Investigations** - NTSB/FAA review all maintenance records after accidents
3. **Complaints** - Reports from mechanics, pilots, or other parties
4. **Routine Surveillance** - FAA monitors Part 135/141 operators continuously
5. **ATC Reports** - ATC may report non-compliant aircraft (e.g., expired transponder)

## Conclusion

This comprehensive research document provides all FAA, CBP, and FCC requirements for aircraft compliance across Part 91 flying clubs, Part 61/141 flight schools, and Part 135 charter operations.

**Key Takeaways:**

1. **Calendar-Based Compliance:** Most inspections are calendar-based (12 or 24 months), making tracking straightforward
2. **Hour-Based Tracking:** 100-hour inspections require tachometer time tracking (not Hobbs)
3. **International Operations:** Additional FCC and CBP requirements add complexity
4. **Part 135:** Highest compliance burden with CAMP, MEL, and continuous FAA oversight
5. **Penalties:** Civil penalties up to $37,500 per violation, plus certificate actions and criminal penalties for willful violations
6. **Documentation:** Complete, accurate maintenance records are critical for all operations

**Implementation in ServantAir System:**
- Track all inspections with color-coded status (Green/Amber/Red)
- Automate alerts at 60/30/15 days before expiration
- Ground aircraft automatically when required items expire
- Show operation restrictions for optional items (e.g., "IFR not permitted")
- Integrate with calendar booking system to prevent non-compliant bookings
